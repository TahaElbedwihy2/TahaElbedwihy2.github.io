        <p>
            I am a student from New Jersey Institute of Technology which ranks in the top 100 colleges in the United States at
            #97. I intend to complete a masters in Business Information Systems as I have good communication skills and a love
            for coding. An important aspect that sets me aside from others, is my attention to detail when I create something.
            I believe if you're going to get something done, you might as well get it done right. I don't like to just complete
            the project, I like to complete it and try to incorporate as many features as possible to create a nice and
            convenient website that the others will ask how I did a certain feature. Another important thing that sets me aside
            from other students is that I will not stop until I get what I want done right and that I will never settle in my
            learnings.
