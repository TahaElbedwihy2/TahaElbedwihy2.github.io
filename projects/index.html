            About My Projects
        </h1>
        <p>
            During the course of my freshman Fall semester in New Jersey Institute of Technology, I learned Python as well as HTML and CSS simultaneously.
            Below, you will find the projects I have completed from the first day of the semester to the last, and will see drastic improvements from each project whether
            it be making the layouts look better, or the functionality of the code overall. Although there are bugs that I now know how to fix, I wanted to leave them up there
            for my first 2 project layouts to remind myself how far I came. All of my projects were done through Webstorm and are uploaded on Github. By looking at the code, you can
            see that I gradually shift from coding from scratch to using open sources such as bootstrap to understand the basics of the infrastructure of websites before I can make it
            easier for myself.

                <b> F and Z Layouts </b>
            </h1>

            <p>
                Almost all websites on the web are composed of F or Z layouts. These layouts are organized by how the person
                will read the website as well as what page you are on in the website. For example, a F layout is used for news
                or blog pages while a Z layout is used for home pages on websites like Apple or tech startups to capture their
                user's attention. Z layouts will typically have a clear high quality photo in the center and text boxed below
                it in the form of a Z. F Layouts will typically have the user read from left to right in the form of an F. The
                difficulties I experienced doing these first 2 layouts was that I couldn't get the sizing to work properly after
                I realized that I was viewing my Chrome browser while it was 33% zoomed out for my F layout, this was my first
                ever website I had created. My second project was the Z layout, you can see I got a little better with the
                sizing as you can view it perfectly when 100% zoomed in on the Chrome browser.... but that's the only good
                viewing angle because if you zoom out the format starts to shift a lot.

                <b> Portfolio Project </b>
            </h1>

            <p>
                The Portfolio Project was the third project I worked on. In this project I had to create a dedicated website for
                myself and my partner. In this project, I worked really hard to make all the layouts of my pages to be able to
                display correctly in almost every zooming aspect. It took me 10 days to complete the website layout but felt a lot
                longer than that due to many bugs with floats and margins. Other than that, I felt the difference when coding
                this project as I knew the right and wrong things to do, and I also knew how to debug my code a lot better. One
                update I would like to make to this website is to make it mobile friendly as well as have better color schemes,
                which will most likely be incorporated into the Marketing Portfolio Rebuild. Don't bother clicking the link because
                this is my portfolio project.
